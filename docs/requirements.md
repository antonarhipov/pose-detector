# Web-based Pose Detector: High-Level Requirements

## Overview
This is a web-based application that uses computer vision to track human movement. The application processes video locally in the browser and provides real-time feedback about the movements.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Video Capture and Processing
- The application must access the user's webcam through browser APIs
- Support for selecting between multiple cameras when available
- Real-time video processing with minimal latency
- All video processing must happen locally in the browser (no server uploads)

### 2. Pose Detection
- Integration with TensorFlow.js and PoseNet for human pose estimation
- Detection and tracking of key body points during movement
- Visualization of detected keypoints and skeleton on video overlay

### 4. User Interface
- Camera widget in the center of the screen
- Pose detection results should be rendered over the camera video

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Technology Stack
- React 18 with TypeScript for frontend development
- HTML5 Video/Canvas APIs for video handling
- TensorFlow.js with PoseNet for pose estimation
- React Context API with custom hooks for state management
- Vite as the build tool

### 2. Performance
- Optimization for real-time processing
- Frame rate control based on device capabilities
- Resolution scaling options for performance adjustment

## Non-Functional Requirements

### 1. Usability
- Intuitive interface requiring minimal training
- Clear visual feedback on exercise performance
- Helpful error messages and recovery options
- Smooth animations and transitions

### 2. Reliability
- Accurate rep counting across different users and body types
- Consistent performance in various lighting conditions
- Graceful handling of camera permission denials
- Recovery from common errors without requiring page refresh

### 3. Compatibility
- Support for major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Functionality on desktop and mobile devices
- Fallback to CPU backend if WebGL is unavailable

### 4. Documentation
- User documentation with usage instructions
- Code documentation with JSDoc comments
- README with setup and usage instructions
- FAQ section for common issues

## Success Criteria
The application will be considered successful when:
1. It accurately detects the pose keypoints and draws the overlay onve the video 
2. Real-time processing occurs with minimal latency
3. The application works across major browsers and devices
4. All processing occurs locally to protect user privacy
5. The UI is implemented as specified
