# Web-based Pose Detector: Development Plan

## 1. Project Overview

This document outlines the development plan for a web-based pose detection application that uses computer vision to track human movement in real-time. The application will process video locally in the browser using TensorFlow.js and PoseNet to detect and visualize human poses.

### Key Features
- Real-time webcam video processing
- Human pose detection and tracking
- Visualization of keypoints and skeleton overlay
- Camera selection functionality
- Performance optimization controls

## 2. Architecture Design

### High-Level Architecture
The application will follow a modern React architecture with TypeScript for type safety:

```
Client (Browser)
├── React Application
│   ├── UI Components
│   ├── Pose Detection Service
│   ├── Video Processing Service
│   └── State Management (Context API)
└── TensorFlow.js with PoseNet
```

### Data Flow
1. Video input from webcam → HTML5 Video element
2. Video frames → Canvas for processing
3. Canvas frames → TensorFlow.js/PoseNet
4. Pose data → React state
5. State → UI rendering (skeleton overlay, etc.)

## 3. Component Breakdown

### Core Components
1. **App Container**
   - Main application wrapper
   - Global state provider

2. **Camera Component**
   - Webcam access and video display
   - Camera selection dropdown
   - Video controls (start/stop)

3. **PoseDetector Service**
   - TensorFlow.js and PoseNet integration
   - Pose estimation logic
   - Keypoint detection and tracking

4. **VideoProcessor Component**
   - Canvas overlay for visualization
   - Skeleton and keypoint rendering
   - Performance optimization controls

5. **Settings Panel**
   - Resolution controls
   - Frame rate adjustment
   - Model confidence threshold settings

6. **Error Handling Component**
   - Permission denial handling
   - Fallback mechanisms
   - User guidance for troubleshooting

### Custom Hooks
1. `useCamera` - Manages webcam access and video stream
2. `usePoseDetection` - Handles pose detection logic
3. `usePerformance` - Controls frame rate and optimization
4. `useDeviceCapabilities` - Detects device capabilities for adaptive settings

## 5. Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Test individual components and hooks
- Use Jest and React Testing Library
- Focus on core functionality and edge cases

### Integration Testing
- Test component interactions
- Verify data flow between components
- Ensure proper state management

### Performance Testing
- Measure and optimize frame rates
- Test on various device capabilities
- Benchmark against performance requirements

### Cross-Browser Testing
- Test on Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- Verify mobile browser compatibility
- Ensure consistent experience across platforms

### User Testing
- Gather feedback on UI/UX
- Verify accuracy of pose detection
- Test in various lighting conditions and environments

## 6. Deployment Plan

### Pre-Deployment Checklist
- Complete all testing phases
- Optimize bundle size
- Implement performance monitoring
- Ensure all documentation is complete

### Deployment Steps
1. Build production-ready bundle with Vite
2. Deploy to static hosting service (GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel)
3. Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments
4. Implement monitoring for performance and errors

### Post-Deployment
- Monitor initial user feedback
- Address any discovered issues
- Prepare for iterative improvements

## 7. Technical Considerations

### Browser Compatibility
- Ensure support for latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, and Safari
- Implement feature detection for critical APIs
- Provide graceful degradation for unsupported features

### Performance Optimization
- Implement lazy loading for TensorFlow.js models
- Use Web Workers for intensive computations when possible
- Optimize render cycles to prevent unnecessary updates
- Implement memory management best practices

### Privacy Considerations
- Ensure all processing happens locally
- No video data leaves the user's device
- Clear communication to users about privacy measures

## 8. Success Metrics

The development will be considered successful when:
1. The application accurately detects pose keypoints and renders the skeleton overlay
2. Processing occurs in real-time with minimal latency
3. The application works consistently across major browsers and devices
4. All processing occurs locally to protect user privacy
5. The UI is implemented according to specifications
6. The codebase is well-documented and maintainable
